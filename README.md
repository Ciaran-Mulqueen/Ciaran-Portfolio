# Ciaran-Portfolio
A showcase of some work I have done in R

# Project: Persimmon Houses web scrapper and data exploration
* Created a tool to gather the listed prices from the Persimmon website to better understand current market pricing, this timelier data gives us a better understanding than government information, which is published monthly with a delay or company reports which are quarterly 
* Scrapped data on over 1900 houses for sale
* Created summary statistics to understand the data relative to government and company releases
* Integrated the data gathered with an address-to-geolocation API to retrieve the longitude and latitude coordinates needed to map the data 
* Mapped the data visually, using ggplot2 and the maps library
